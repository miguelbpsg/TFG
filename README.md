Implementation of distributed systems test under the dioco bounded conformance relation

In order for the implementation to work, you shall introduce your adecuate path at src/main.java for both the implementation and the specification
It is allowed to change the bound on the conformance relation. You can find int as "k" in src/main.java. Be careful though, as these problems grow exponentially, the required time to test with a little increase of the value of k might increase the result output a very long time.

There are some example files in src/files for implementations and specifications
